# Covid19_Vaccine_Degradation_Prediction

As the world currently battles Covid19 and with the emergence of Covid19 vaccines. This notebook aims to make a prediction of the vaccines by understudying the degradation rate of the mRNA bases.
This gives an insight as to whether some of these vaccines can actually travel across the world without having any of its component degraded.
